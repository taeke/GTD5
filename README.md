I am a fan of David Allen's Getting Things Done : http://gettingthingsdone.com/

I have tried many different applications to work with this system, but have always returned to plain text file and a good text editor. My latest favorite is GitHubs Atom. The biggest problem is that it's only available in my home network. So it is time to build my own "perfect" on-line application. It is also a good opportunity to learn some new tools and get a deeper understanding of some tools i already use.

At this moment i am thinking of building with the following tools, frameworks etcetera:
- A Html5 / CSS3 single page app build with angularJS;
- A NodeJs Restful service with MongoDB.
- A raspberryPi to run the NodeJs server.
